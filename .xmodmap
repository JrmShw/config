! no need to remove lock if the layout is Colemak
remove control = Control_L

! keycode 37 = left Ctrl key
keycode 37 = Caps_Lock
add lock = Caps_Lock

! keycode 66 = Caps Lock key
! the second Control_L is needed so that
!   Shift + Ctrl works the same as Ctrl + Shift
keycode 66 = Control_L Control_L
add control = Control_L


! keycode 105 = right Ctrl key
! keysym 'Menu' opens the context menu
! removing Control is especially important if "sticky keys" is enabled
remove control = Control_R
keycode 105 = Menu

! the following assumes a Colemak keyboard layout
! remap AltGr + [n,e,i,o] keys from:
!   "dead_caron asciitilde" to "Home Home"
!   "ntilde Ntilde"         to "Down Down"
!   "eacute Eacute"         to "Up Up"
!   "iacute Iacute"         to "Left Left"
!   "oacute Oacute"         to "Right Right"
!   "otilde Otilde"         to "End End"
! diacritics can be placed above letters by using AltGr + [`,r,t], so remapping [ñ,é,í,ó,õ] does not remove functionality
! remapping AltGr+h does remove functionality, though: it's used for carons
