! no need to remove lock if the layout is Colemak
remove control = Control_L

! keycode 37 = left Ctrl key
keycode 37 = Caps_Lock
add lock = Caps_Lock

! keycode 66 = Caps Lock key
! the second Control_L is needed so that
!   Shift + Ctrl works the same as Ctrl + Shift
keycode 66 = Control_L Control_L
add control = Control_L


! keycode 105 = right Ctrl key
! keysym 'Menu' opens the context menu
! removing Control is especially important if "sticky keys" is enabled
remove control = Control_R
keycode 105 = Menu

! the following assumes a Colemak keyboard layout
! remap AltGr + [n,e,i,o] keys from:
!   "ntilde Ntilde" to "Down Down"
!   "eacute Eacute" to "Up Up"
!   "iacute Iacute" to "Left Left"
!   "oacute Oacute" to "Right Right"
! diacritics can be placed above letters by using AltGr + [`,r,t], so remapping [ñ,é,í,ó] does not remove functionality
! rationale for key placement:
!   <Down> and <Up> will be most used because of menus, so they should be under the two strongest fingers
!     mapping Down under n and Up under e retains consistency with my vi bindings
!   <Left> and <Right> deserve to be more easily accessible than my vi bindings
keycode  44 = n N n N Down Down
keycode  45 = e E e E Up Up
keycode  46 = i I i I Left Left
keycode  47 = o O o O Right Right
